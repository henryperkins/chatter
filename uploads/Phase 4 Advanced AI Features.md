Alright, here's the prompt for **Phase 4**, focusing on advanced AI and conversation features, while maintaining the distinction between project-based and independent conversations:

**# Phase 4: Advanced AI and Conversation Features (Revised)**

## **Overview**

Phase 4 focuses on integrating advanced AI capabilities and enhancing conversation management features for both project-based and independent conversations. Building upon the robust foundation established in Phase 3, this phase aims to create a more intelligent and interactive chat experience. Key objectives include:

-   **Advanced AI Integration:** Implement personality adjustments, proactive assistance, and sentiment analysis, taking into account if a project is active.
-   **Enhanced Conversation Management:** Implement semantic search, conversation sharing, and exporting, taking into account if a project is active.
-   **Performance Optimization:** Begin optimizing core components for performance and scalability.

By the end of Phase 4, the chat application will offer a significantly more sophisticated and user-friendly experience, ready for the final polishing and broader user testing in the remaining phases, making use of the project features from Phase 1 to improve the AI performance.

## **Core Components Implementation Requirements**

### **1. Advanced AI Enhancements**

#### **Required Functionality**

-   **Personality Adjustments:**
    - Allow users to customize the AI's personality (tone, creativity) using parameters like temperature or predefined profiles.
    - The AI should adapt its personality based on the selected language model for project based conversations, *or* based on a default setting for unassociated conversations.
    -   **UI/UX:** Design intuitive controls for personality adjustments, allowing for both project-specific and default settings.
    -   **Error Handling:** Handle invalid parameter values or profile configurations.

-   **Proactive Assistance:**
    - Implement proactive suggestions and assistance based on conversation context, using RAG for project-based conversations and using chat history for independent conversations.
    -   **Relevance:** Ensure suggestions are relevant and helpful in the context of project or independent chats.
    -   **Performance:** Optimize proactive assistance to avoid excessive API calls or processing.

-   **Sentiment Analysis:**
    - Analyze user messages for sentiment and adjust the AI's responses accordingly.
    -   **Accuracy:** Use reliable sentiment analysis libraries and techniques.
    -   **Integration:** Integrate sentiment analysis seamlessly into the AI response generation process, affecting both project-based RAG responses and unassociated conversation responses.

#### **Example Code (Backend - Python - Conceptual)**

```python
# Example for personality adjustments
def get_ai_response(message, conversation_history, personality_profile="default", project_id=None, language_model='gpt-3.5-turbo'):
    """
      Adjust AI response based on personality and also by using the given project_id or the language_model to determine the RAG context or conversation history context.
    """
    # ... use personality_profile to adjust API parameters (e.g., temperature), also using the given project_id or the language_model to determine the RAG context or conversation history context
    pass

# Example for proactive assistance (conceptual)
def suggest_next_action(conversation_history, project_id = None):
    """
       Provide proactive assistance, using the RAG functionality if a project_id is provided
    """
    # ... analyze conversation history to suggest relevant actions or information
    # ... if project_id is provided, make sure to use RAG to create the proactive response
    pass
```

**Additional Notes:**

-   **AI Model Selection:** Choose appropriate AI models and libraries for personality adjustments, proactive assistance, and sentiment analysis.
-   **Testing:** Thoroughly test these features to ensure they function as expected and enhance the user experience.

### **2. Enhanced Conversation Management**

#### **Required Functionality**

-   **Semantic Search:**
    - Implement semantic search functionality to allow users to search conversations based on meaning, including project-based conversations and also independent conversations.
    -   **NLP Integration:** Integrate with NLP libraries (e.g., spaCy, NLTK) for semantic analysis.
    -   **Performance:** Optimize search indexing and retrieval for speed and efficiency.

-   **Conversation Sharing and Exporting:**
    - Allow users to share conversations with others via shareable links or export them in various formats (JSON, PDF, etc.), allowing the user to select either project-based or unassociated conversations for sharing/exporting.
    -   **Security:** Implement appropriate access controls for shared conversations.
    -   **Error Handling:** Handle share/export failures gracefully.

#### **Example Code (Backend - Python - Conceptual)**

```python
# Example for semantic search (conceptual)
def search_conversations(query, user_id, project_id = None):
    """
      Search the conversations, using RAG if a project_id is provided, and searching user messages if not.
    """
    # ... use NLP techniques to perform semantic search on conversation data, optionally filtering results by project_id or by user messages if not specified
    pass

# Example for conversation export (conceptual)
def export_conversation(conversation_id, format="json", project_id = None):
    """Export the data for a conversation, or project data if a project_id is provided"""
    # ... retrieve conversation data and export it in the specified format, using project_id to filter
    pass
```

**Additional Notes:**

-   **User Interface:** Design clear and intuitive UI elements for search, sharing, and exporting.
-   **Data Handling:** Manage shared conversation data and access permissions effectively.

---

### **Configuration System**

#### **Environment Variables**

-   `NLP_MODEL_PATH`: Path to the NLP model for semantic search.
-   `ALLOWED_EXPORT_FORMATS`: Comma-separated list of allowed export formats.

---

### **Error Handling**

*  Continue to refine error handling and logging for all AI and Conversation features, accounting for project based data and unassociated data.

---

### **Conclusion**

Implementing Phase 4 integrates advanced AI capabilities and enhances conversation management, taking into account both project-based and independent conversation modes. This brings the chat application closer to its final form. The next phases will focus on refining the user experience, optimizing performance, and conducting thorough testing.

That's Phase 4! Let me know if you'd like to move on to Phase 5 or have any other questions!
